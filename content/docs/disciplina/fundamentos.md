### Aglaonice

- **150 BCE**: **Aglaonice** became the first female astronomer to be recorded in Ancient Greece; she **could predict the time and general area where a lunar eclipse would occur**


### Sophia Brahe

- **1572**: Danish scientist **Sophia Brahe** assisted her brother Tycho Brahe with his astronomical observations 

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcondt5Ge995PebRbMmCshH_KCqcoCk0K7fawdcAmv4zoUdLd8HE47eT99c6wukqWHEcBnSf9EiPi7Qt9yD_hXb1C4ioWLhTKHjNEBClkKe3bjcu6is2IgjLndUba4sFnN6uJ5jIYj_udarLDBrN-9fJ8ze?key=Gc27NQbdFn2IdDy-T3B5-A)<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Brahe>

Tycho wrote that he had trained Sophia in horticulture and chemistry, but he initially discouraged her from studying astronomy. Instead, Sophia learned astronomy on her own, studying books in German, and having Latin books translated with her own money so that she could read them as well. Later in both of their careers, Tycho began to discourage her from continuing her research into astronomy because he believed it to be too complex for the talents of a woman.

Sophia frequently visited Uranienborg, Tycho's observatory on the then-Danish island of Hveen. There, she assisted him with astronomical observations associated with his publication De nova stella, or On the New Star. Specifically, she assisted with a set of observations on 11 November 1572, which led to the discovery of the supernova that is now called SN 1572, as well as observations of the 8 December 1573 lunar eclipse. The discovery of SN 1572 was especially significant in that it added to the growing body of evidence that seemed to refute the geocentric model of the universe. Sophia's assistance was also instrumental in Tycho's work on orbits, which was foundational to the modern methods used to predict the positions of the planets. Tycho's studies of orbits involved the most precise measurements of the planets' movements made prior to the invention of the telescope, and while Tycho created many of the astronomical devices used to conduct the measurements, Sophia was among the assistants who actually made the measurements. Tycho did have other assistants, however, and while Sophia was present for each of these discoveries, the extent to which she contributed personally is unknown. Tycho did commend Sophia for her efforts, though, referring with admiration to Sophia's animus invictus, or "determined mind."

After her series of contributions in the 1570s, Sophia achieved more autonomy with regards to her astronomical research than before. Despite the serious doubts Tycho had previously expressed about Sophia's ability to comprehend the nuances of horoscopes, when he was frequently away from Uranienborg between 1588 and 1597, Sophia took on much of Tycho's astrological responsibilities with their clients.

Once some major observations were made by the Brahes, Tycho requested money from King Frederick II of Denmark, Frederick the Great, to move forward with more observation facilities in Hveen. The king was under the impression that the observatories were for Tycho and his personal research; however it is known that some of the observatories were made for Sophia to work in for her own observations. Much of the data that was gathered throughout Tycho's life was passed down to his pupil, Johannes Kepler, rather than his sister, Sophia Brahe. It can be said that the work that Sophia Brahe assisted her brother in laid the groundwork for Sir Isaac Newton.


### Maria Cunitz

- **1650**: Silesian astronomer **Maria Cunitz published Urania Propitia, a work that both simplified and substantially improved Johannes Kepler's mathematical methods for locating planets**. The book was published in both Latin and German, an unconventional decision that made the scientific text more accessible for non-university educated readers

### Jeanne Dumée

- **1680**: French astronomer **Jeanne Dumée** published a summary of arguments supporting the Copernican theory of heliocentrism. She was the author of Conversations on Copernicus’ Opinion on the Movement of the Earth, that **explains the Copernican system**. The manuscript supported Copernican and Galilean theories on earth's movement. She also wrote on her **observations of Venus and moons of Jupiter, which proved Copernicus and Galileo's theories**. She wrote "between the brain of a woman and that of a man there is no difference"


### Elisabetha Koopman Hevelius

- **1690**: German-Polish astronomer **Elisabetha Koopman Hevelius** worked with Johannes Hevelius, her husband, assisting with observations and, probably, computations for over twenty years. After he died, she published in his name Prodromus Astronomiae, **the largest and most accurate star catalog** to that date, which documented the positions and relevant data for 1,564 stars

### Maria Clara Eimmart

- **1693–1698**: German astronomer and illustrator **Maria Clara Eimmart** is best known for her **exact astronomical illustrations** done in pale pastels on dark blue cardboard. Between 1693 and 1698, Eimmart made over 350 drawings of the phases of the moon. This collection of drawings, drawn solely from observations through a telescope, was entitled Micrographia stellarum phases lunae ultra 300

### Émilie du Châtelet

- **1738**: French polymath **Émilie du Châtelet** became the first woman to have a paper published by the Paris Academy, following a contest on the nature of fire. Her most recognized achievement is her **translation of and commentary on Isaac Newton's 1687 book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica containing basic laws of physics**. The translation, published posthumously in 1756, is still considered the standard French translation. Her commentary **includes a contribution to Newtonian mechanics** – the postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element. **This led her to conceptualize energy, and to derive its quantitative relationships to the mass and velocity of an object**.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcTnxD6SsqLohs_A5nJ4nYDBM5upzFjjdmNJw7g2-J1VC2OuXIwFadYiUs1P9o4SKEI9HXH96PJN_zsNNLn4ZHwPQxud0U_COIGzcQuVyTAGgUboX-wMBG3EY4Tf6rD3wEgVYWF9ew8IXVr8xbZEkPa21Cv?key=Gc27NQbdFn2IdDy-T3B5-A)<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89milie_du_Ch%C3%A2telet>

She published the book Institutions de Physique, where she discussed, refuted, and synthesized many ideas of prominent mathematicians and physicists of the time. In particular, the text is famous for discussing ideas that originated with G.W. Leibniz and Christian Wolff, and for using the principle of sufficient reason often associated with their philosophical work. This main work is equally famous for providing a detailed discussion and evaluation of ideas that originated with Isaac Newton and his followers. That combination is more remarkable than it might seem now, since the ideas of Leibniz and Newton were regarded as fundamentally opposed to one another by most of the major philosophical figures of the 18th century.

In the Institutions she broke down the concept of matter into three parts: the macroscopic substance available to sensory perception, the atoms composing that macroscopic material, and an even smaller constituent unit similarly imperceptible to human senses. However, she carefully added that there was no way to know how many levels truly existed. Du Châtelet  also considered more metaphysics and classical mechanics, discussing the concepts of space and time in a manner more consistent with modern relativity than her contemporaries. She described both space and time in the abstract, as representations of the relationships between coexistent bodies rather than physical substances. This included an acknowledgement that "absolute" place is an idealization and that "relative" place is the only real, measurable quantity. Du Châtelet also presented a thorough explanation of Newton’s laws of motion and their function on earth.

Immanuel Kant's first publication in 1747, 'Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces', focused on du Châtelet's pamphlet against the secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, Mairan. Kant's opponent, Johann Augustus Eberhard, accused Kant of taking ideas from du Châtelet. lnterestingly, Kant, in his Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, wrote sexist critiques of learned women of the time including Mme Du Châtelet, stating: "A woman who has a head full of Greek, like Mme. Dacier, or who conducts disputations about mechanics, like the Marquise du Châtelet might as well also wear a beard; for that might perhaps better express the mien of depth for which they strive."

Although in the early 18th century the concepts of force and momentum had been long understood, the idea of energy as being transferable between different systems was still in its infancy, and would not be fully resolved until the 19th century. It is now accepted that the total mechanical momentum of a system is conserved and that none is lost to friction. Simply put, there is no 'momentum friction', and momentum cannot transfer between different forms, and particularly there is no 'potential momentum'. In the 20th century, Emmy Noether proved this to be true for all problems where the initial state is symmetric in generalized coordinates. Mechanical energy, either kinetic or potential, may be lost to another form, but the total is conserved in time.

Du Châtelet's contribution was the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. In doing so, **she became the first to elucidate the concept of energy as such, and to quantify its relationship to mass and velocity based on her own empirical studies**. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by Willem's Gravesande in which heavy balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy – as indicated by the quantity of material displaced – was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity: She showed that if two balls were identical except for their mass, they would make the same size indentation in the clay if the quantity _mv²_ were the same for each ball.

Newton's work assumed the exact conservation of only mechanical momentum. A broad range of mechanical problems in physics are soluble only if energy conservation is included. The collision and scattering of two point masses is one example. Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange established a more formal framework for mechanics using the results of du Châtelet.

In 1749, the year of du Châtelet's death, she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her commentary, of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (often referred to as simply the Principia), including her derivation of the notion of conservation of energy from its principles of mechanics. Despite modern misconceptions, Newton's work on his Principia was not perfect. Du Châtelet took on the task of not only translating his work from Latin to French, but adding important information to it as well. Her commentary was as essential to her contemporaries as her spreading of Newton's ideas. Du Châtelet's commentary was very extensive, comprising almost two-thirds of volume II of her edition.

To undertake a formidable project such as this, du Châtelet prepared to translate the Principia by continuing her studies in analytic geometry, mastering calculus, and reading important works in experimental physics. It was her rigorous preparation that allowed her to add a lot more accurate information to her commentary, both from herself and other scientists she studied or worked with. She was one of only 20 or so people in the 1700s who could understand such advanced math and apply the knowledge to other works. This helped du Châtelet greatly, not only with her work on the Principia but also in her other important works like the Institutions de Physique.

Du Châtelet made very important corrections in her translation that helped support Newton's theories about the universe. Newton, based on the theory of fluids, suggested that gravitational attraction would cause the poles of the earth to flatten, thus causing the earth to bulge outwards at the equator. In Clairaut's Memoire, which confirmed Newton's hypothesis about the shape of the earth and gave more accurate approximations, Clairaut discovered a way to determine the shape of the other planets in the solar system. Du Châtelet used Clairaut's proposal that the planets had different densities in her commentary to correct Newton's belief that the earth and the other planets were made of homogenous substances.

Du Châtelet used the work of Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician and physicist, to further explain Newton's theory of the tides. This proof depended upon the three-body problem which still confounded even the best mathematicians in 18th century Europe. Using Clairaut's hypothesis about the differing of the planets' densities, Bernoulli theorized that the moon was 70 times denser than Newton had believed. Du Châtelet used this discovery in her commentary of the Principia, further supporting Newton's theory about the law of gravitation.

Published ten years after her death, **today du Châtelet's translation of the Principia is still the standard translation of the work into French, and remains the only complete rendition in that language**. Her translation was so important that it was the only one in any language used by Newtonian expert I. Bernard Cohen to write his own English version of Newton's Principia. Du Châtelet not only used the works of other great scientists to revise Newton's work, but she added her own thoughts and ideas as a scientist in her own right. Her contributions in the French translation made Newton and his ideas look even better in the scientific community and around the world, and recognition for this is owed to du Châtelet. This enormous project, along with her Foundations of Physics, proved du Châtelet's abilities as a great mathematician.\[38] Her translation and commentary of the Principia contributed to the completion of the scientific revolution in France and to its acceptance in Europe.


### Caroline Herschel

- **1786–1797**: German astronomer Caroline Herschel discovered eight new comets, along with numerous other discoveries. She was the younger sister of astronomer William Herschel, with whom she worked throughout her career.

- She was the first woman to receive a salary as a scientist and the first woman in England to hold a government position.

- She was also the first woman to publish scientific findings in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, to be awarded a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1828), and to be named an honorary Member of the Royal Astronomical Society (1835, with Mary Somerville). She was named an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (1838). The King of Prussia presented her with a Gold Medal for Science on the occasion of her 96th birthday (1846).

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeAPENdTxG05HL2o74-t3qpMPcCXT5yK8nj1B0RHoA2JthVo4YkV8RlGblCJ0OSf2YtHDkLsnGAFS9f24KP7pAMZS4_Gpz2ioDhjaqnhqohjo877Llfe4P2aR7gJq6BT-bmxz1XPQ8DHVD-o2eKGv6xYHdb?key=Gc27NQbdFn2IdDy-T3B5-A)<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Herschel>

On 28 August 1782, Caroline initiated her first record book. She inscribed the first three opening pages: "This is what I call the Bills & Rec.ds of my Comets", "Comets and Letters", and "Books of Observations". This, along with two subsequent books, currently belong to the Herschel trove at the Royal Astronomical Society in London.

During 1786–1797 she discovered eight comets, the first on 1 August 1786 while her brother was away and she was using his telescope. She had unquestioned priority as discoverer of five of the comets and rediscovered Comet Encke in 1795. Five of her comets were published in Philosophical Transactions. A packet of paper bearing the superscription, "This is what I call the Bills and Receipts of my Comets" contains some data connected with the discovery of each of these objects.

On 26 February 1783, Caroline made her first discovery: she had found a nebula that was not included in the Messier catalogue. That same night, she independently discovered Messier 110 (NGC 205), the second companion of the Andromeda Galaxy. 

In 1798 Caroline presented to the Royal Society an index to John Flamsteed’s observations, together with a catalog of 560 stars omitted from the British Catalogue and a list of the errata in that publication. Because Flamsteed's catalogue was organized by constellation, it was less useful to the Herschels, so Caroline created her own catalogue organized by north polar distance.

In 1797 William's observations had shown that there were a great many discrepancies in the star catalogue published by John Flamsteed, which was difficult to use because it had been published as two volumes, the catalogue proper and a volume of original observations, and contained many errors. William realised that he needed a proper cross-index to properly explore these differences but was reluctant to devote time to it at the expense of his more interesting astronomical activities. He therefore recommended to Caroline that she undertake the task, which ultimately took 20 months. The resulting Catalogue of Stars, Taken from Mr. Flamsteed's Observations Contained in the Second Volume of the Historia Coelestis, and Not Inserted in the British Catalogue was published by the Royal Society in 1798 and contained an index of every observation of every star made by Flamsteed, a list of errata, and a list of more than 560 stars that had not been included.

In 1802, the Royal Society published Caroline's catalogue in its Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A under William's name. This listed around 500 new nebulae and clusters to the already known 2,000.

Toward the end of Caroline's life, she arranged 2,500 nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances so that her nephew, John Herschel, could re-examine them systematically. The list was eventually enlarged and renamed the New General Catalogue. Many non-stellar objects are still identified by their NGC number.


### Margaret Bryan

- **1797**: published _A Compendious System of Astronomy_, collecting her lectures on astronomy and including an engraving of herself and her two daughters. She dedicated the book to her students. The lectures of which the book consisted had been praised by Charles Hutton, then at Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.

- **1806**: published _Lectures on Natural Philosophy_, a textbook on the fundamentals of physics and astronomy. There were thirteen lectures on hydrostatics, optics, pneumatics, and acoustics.

- **1815**: published _An Astronomical and Geographical Class Book for the Use of Schools and Private Families_. The lectures had been previously available only to noblemen, educators, and booksellers. The text was supplemented with diagrams as well as portions for exercises. She described the mechanics of the air rifle, the hot air balloon, the diving bell, as well as works of Isaac Newton, Galileo, and Benjamin Franklin, including the latter's experiments with lightning.

- A pioneer of female education, she taught science to women and girls from her schools in Margate and London.

### Mary Somerville

- **1835**: Scottish polymath Mary Somerville and German astronomer Caroline Herschel were elected the first female members of the Royal Astronomical Society.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcdNzjCLfffoLDAJ6uvjoju6EdOdMbxHCH3zpfXIGEj_XqHJr7XTQ6lqGlXELTM46ahAcevhU7k4mgtnEcXDrs8iNEVLz5WAUeYnKgJtQQALXXjRE_XeISagDFOvielGCwuAOrlWb_SkDRP_VUGFhVPdVw?key=Gc27NQbdFn2IdDy-T3B5-A)<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville>

Somerville conducted experiments to explore the relationship between light and magnetism. Her first paper, "_The magnetic properties of the violet rays of the solar spectrum_", was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1826. Although her conclusions were faulty, the topic was of popular interest at the time. Using a sample of silver nitrate supplied by Michael Faraday, Somerville conducted experiments on the blackening effect of sunlight, the reaction used in early experiments in photography. She later developed her technique by using an optical prism and vegetable dyes, producing an early version of the optical spectrometer

Lord Brougham asked Somerville to translate the _Mécanique Céleste_ of Pierre-Simon Laplace for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Laplace had, in five exhaustive volumes, summed up the current state of gravitational mathematics. _Mécanique Céleste_ was acclaimed as the greatest intellectual achievement since the _Principia_. Somerville produced not just a translation, but also an expanded version of the first two volumes. She wrote a standalone exposition of the mathematics behind the workings of the Solar System, of which she said "I translated Laplace's work from algebra into common language". It was published in 1831, under the title of _The Mechanism of the Heavens_, and it immediately made her famous. Until the 1880s _Mechanism_ was set as a textbook for undergraduates at the University of Cambridge.

She was among those who discussed a hypothetical planet perturbing Uranus. In the 6th edition of _On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences_ (1842). Predictions were fulfilled in 1846 with the discovery of Neptune revolving at a distance of 3,000,000,000 miles from the Sun.

Her book _Physical Geography_ was published in 1848 and was the first English textbook on the subject. It remained in use until the early 20th century. Somerville starts the book with describing the overall structure of planet Earth, along with a brief allusion to the location of the Earth within the Solar System. Subsequently, the book focuses on terrestrial topics, such as the most basic features of land and water, and formations such as mountains, volcanoes, oceans, rivers and lakes. Somerville goes on to discuss the elements that govern temperature, such as light, electricity, storms, the aurora and magnetism. Eventually the book turns to vegetation, birds and mammals, and their geographical distribution in the Arctic, Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the Antarctic. Somerville ends the book with a discussion of "the distribution, condition, and future prospects of the human race". She emphasises the reciprocal dependencies in physical geography and the relationship between human beings and nature.


### Thereza Dillwyn Llewelyn

- **1855**: Working with her father, Welsh astronomer and photographer Thereza Dillwyn Llewelyn produced some of the earliest photographs of the moon.

- Collaboration between Llewelyn and her father also extended to meteorology, as they contributed to the maintenance and monitoring of the British Science Association's volunteer weather stations. Llewelyn managed the meteorological records and hoped to present her observations in person at a meeting of the Association. However, her father did not allow her to attend.

### Marie Curie

- **1900**: Physicists Marie Skłodowska–Curie and Isabelle Stone attended the first International Congress of Physics in Paris, France. They were the only two women out of 836 participants.

- **1903**: Polish-born physicist and chemist Marie Skłodowska–Curie became the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize when she received the Nobel Prize in Physics along with her husband, Pierre Curie, "for their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel", and Henri Becquerel, "for his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity".

- **1911**: Polish-born physicist and chemist Marie Curie became the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which she received "\[for] the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element".

- Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.

- **1906**: She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf80aFwwmTJXsnKoiM8rH7IUTXMB8wgMTtTO0wFczcfBdm9ZJtok6YISKMwP9w7z9wlMpdUgSB2cTPPR46Ju5n8p7TusF6j73jtEzHTC27c9zfJUEgWcy-2kcI61letTlO-WD4lvqUJmpLQy662oTp02WN0?key=Gc27NQbdFn2IdDy-T3B5-A)https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie\_Curie

Cornell University professor L. Pearce Williams observes:

“The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. **It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics**. **On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom**. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. **In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked**.”


### Annie Jump Cannon

- **1901**: American astronomer Annie Jump Cannon published her first catalog of stellar spectra, which classified stars by temperature, the Harvard Classification Scheme. This method was universally and permanently adopted by other astronomers.

- Cannon manually classified more stars in a lifetime than anyone else, with a total of around 350,000 stars. She discovered 300 variable stars, five novas, and one spectroscopic binary, creating a bibliography that included about 200,000 references.

- She was a suffragist and a member of the National Women's Party.

- **1911**: she was made the Curator of Astronomical Photographs at Harvard.

- **1914**: she was admitted as an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society.

- **1921**: she became one of the first women to receive an honorary doctorate from a European university when she was awarded an honorary doctor's degree in math and astronomy from Groningen University.

- **1922**: the International Astronomical Union passed the resolution to formally adopt Cannon's stellar classification system; with only minor changes, it is still being used for classification today.

- **1925**: she became the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate of science from Oxford University.

In 1896, Cannon became a member of the Harvard Computers, a group of women hired by Harvard Observatory director Edward C. Pickering. Men at the laboratory did the labor of operating the telescopes and taking photographs while the women examined the data, carried out astronomical calculations, and cataloged those photographs during the day.


### Henrietta Swan Leavitt

- **1908**: Leavitt published the results of her studies in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College, noting that the brighter variables had the longer period.

- **1912**: American astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt studied the bright-dim cycle periods of Cepheid stars, then found a way to calculate the distance from such stars to Earth. Her discovery of how to effectively measure vast distances to remote galaxies led to a shift in the scale and understanding of the scale and the nature of the universe. Leavitt examined the relationship between the periods and the brightness of a sample of 25 of the Cepheids variables in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Leavitt made a graph of magnitude versus logarithm of period showing that there is a simple relation between the brightness of the Cepheid variables and their periods.

- **1913**: Leavitt discovered T Pyxidis, a recurrent nova in the constellation Pyxis, and one of the most frequent recurrent novae in the sky, with eruptions observed in 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1967, and 2011.

- Leavitt was a member of the American Association of University Women, the American Astronomical and Astrophysical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an honorary member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfqYJgeLbMfqPLmNpqmlqAOW1n2merBtIyhiLIEjPkYs0M_qWBfgM4QRWY-g_sTxkmJMPjyetKjkJz-dTqJt7sVr_fEmucj-QzZwfdenqkoXjL8QhceVwb2Xg3opGbPhNo0uiJAIX11hM77IXB5rQxZ0TM?key=Gc27NQbdFn2IdDy-T3B5-A)https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta\_Swan\_Leavitt

Leavitt's discovery provided astronomers with the first standard candle with which to measure the distance to other galaxies. Before Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables (sometimes referred to as Leavitt's Law), the only techniques available to astronomers for measuring the distance to a star were based on stellar parallax. Such techniques can only be used for measuring distances out to several hundred light years. Leavitt's great insight was that while no one knew the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud, all its stars must be roughly the same distance from Earth. Therefore, a relationship she discovered in it, between the period of certain variable stars (Cepheids) and their apparent brightness, reflected a relationship in their absolute brightness. Once calibrated by measuring the distance to a nearby star of the same type via parallax, her discovery became a measuring stick with vastly greater reach.

After Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble found Cepheids in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula, and, using Leavitt's Law, calculated that their distance was far too great to be part of the Milky Way and were separate galaxies in their own right. This settled astronomy's Great Debate over the size of the universe. Hubble later used Leavitt's Law, together with galactic redshifts, to establish that the universe is expanding.


### Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin

- **1925**: British-American astronomer and astrophysicist Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin established that hydrogen is the most common element in stars, and thus the most abundant element in the universe. Her work on the nature of variable stars was foundational to modern astrophysics.

- **1943**: She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

- **1956**: she became the first woman to be promoted to full professor from within the faculty at Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Payne was able to accurately relate the spectral classes of stars to their actual temperatures by applying Indian physicist Meghnad Saha's ionization theory. She showed that the great variation in stellar absorption lines was due to differing amounts of ionization at different temperatures, not to different amounts of elements. She found that silicon, carbon, and other common metals seen in the Sun's spectrum were present in about the same relative amounts as on Earth, in agreement with the accepted belief of the time, which held that the stars had approximately the same elemental composition as the Earth. However, she found that helium and particularly hydrogen were vastly more abundant (for hydrogen, by a factor of about one million). Her thesis concluded that hydrogen was the overwhelming constituent of stars, making it the most abundant element in the Universe.


### Inge Lehmann

- **1936**: Danish seismologist and geophysicist Inge Lehmann discovered that the Earth has a solid inner core distinct from its molten outer core.

- The seismic discontinuity in the speed of seismic waves at depths between 190 and 250 km is named the Lehmann discontinuity after her. Lehmann is considered to be a pioneer among women and scientists in seismology research.


### Jocelyn Bell Burnell

- **1967**: British astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell co-discovered the first radio pulsars.

- **2018**: British astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell received the special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for her scientific achievements and "inspiring leadership", worth $3 million. She donated the entirety of the prize money towards the creation of scholarships to assist women, underrepresented minorities and refugees who are pursuing the study of physics.

- As a postgraduate student, she discovered the first radio pulsars in 1967. The discovery eventually earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974; however, she was not one of the prize's recipients.

- By carefully timing the pulses from pulsars widely scattered within our galaxy, the astronomers hope to measure slight variations caused by the passage of the gravitational waves. The scientists hope such pulsar timing arrays can detect gravitational waves caused by the motions of supermassive pairs of black holes in the early universe, cosmic strings, and possibly from other exotic events in the first few seconds after the Big Bang.

- Pulsars can be used to test general relativity in conditions of extremely strong gravity. By measuring the properties of neutron stars through pulsar pulses, astronomers can precisely test general relativity.

- Pulsars are useful for measuring long distances across space because of their precise rotations.

- Pulsars allowed astronomers to study neutron stars, which are the only place where the behavior of matter at nuclear density can be observed.

### Margaret Burbidge

- **1976**: Margaret Burbidge was named the first female president of the American Astronomical Society.

- British-American observational astronomer and astrophysicist. In the 1950s, she was one of the founders of stellar nucleosynthesis and was first author of the influential B2FH paper.

- During the 1960s and 1970s she worked on galaxy rotation curves and quasars, discovering the most distant astronomical object then known.

- In the 1980s and 1990s she helped develop and utilise the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope.

- Burbidge was also well known for her work opposing discrimination against women in astronomy.

During the Second World War, she acted as a caretaker at University of London Observatory (ULO); the wartime blackout made it easier for her to use the observatory's telescopes. In August 1944, her observations at ULO were twice interrupted by V-1 flying bomb explosions nearby. She was turned down for a postdoctoral fellowship from Carnegie Observatories in 1945 because the job required observing at Mount Wilson Observatory, which was reserved for men only at that time.

She returned to the UK in 1953, when Margaret and her husband Geoffrey Burbidge were invited to work with William Alfred Fowler and Fred Hoyle at the University of Cambridge. The team combined data on elemental abundances produced by the Burbidges with Hoyle's hypothesis that all chemical elements might be produced in stars by a series of nuclear reactions, and Fowler's laboratory experiments on those reactions. The idea became known as stellar nucleosynthesis. They published their model in a series of papers, culminating in a magnum opus in 1957, now known as the B2FH paper after the initials of Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle. Margaret Burbidge was the first author of the paper, which was written while she was pregnant. The paper demonstrated that most heavier chemical elements were formed in stellar evolution. The theory they developed remains the fundamental basis for stellar nucleosynthesis. Fowler was later awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar) for his work on nucleosynthesis, and expressed surprise that Burbidge was not included.

When Fowler moved back to the U.S., he advised the Burbidges to come with him to California, suggesting Margaret (the observer) should re-apply for the fellowship at Mount Wilson Observatory while Geoff (the theorist) should seek the Kellogg Fellowship at Caltech. Margaret's application was again refused on gender grounds, so the couple swapped applications. Geoff won the position at Mount Wilson, while Margaret took the Caltech job in 1955. Whenever Geoff was required to go observing on Mount Wilson, Margaret would accompany him, ostensibly as his assistant. In reality, Geoff worked in the photographic dark room while Margaret operated the telescope. When the observatory's management found out, they eventually agreed that she could observe there, but only if she and her husband stayed in a separate self-catered cottage on the grounds, rather than the catered dormitory which had been designed for men only.

In the 1960s and 1970s she measured the masses, compositions, and rotation curves of galaxies and performed early spectroscopic studies of quasars. Her discoveries in this area included QSO B1442+101 at a redshift of 3.5, making it the most distant known object at the time, a record which she held from 1974 to 1982. She was a supporter of the steady state theory of cosmology, but her own work on quasars helped to support the alternative Big Bang theory.

Burbidge campaigned in opposition to discrimination against women in astronomy and was also opposed to positive discrimination. In 1972 she turned down the Annie J. Cannon Award of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) because it was awarded to women only: "It is high time that discrimination in favor of, as well as against, women in professional life be removed". Her letter declining the prize caused the AAS to set up its first committee on the status of women in astronomy. In 1976, she became the first female president of the AAS. During her term as president she convinced the members to ban AAS meetings in states which had not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution. In 1984 the AAS awarded her its highest honor, regardless of gender, the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship.

At UCSD she helped develop the Faint Object Spectrograph for the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched in 1990. With this instrument, she and her team discovered that the galaxy Messier 82 contains a supermassive black hole at its center. As professor emerita at UCSD she continued to be active in research until the early 21st century. Burbidge authored over 370 research papers.


### Kathy Vivas

- **2000**: Venezuelan astrophysicist Kathy Vivas presented her discovery of approximately 100 "new and very distant" RR Lyrae stars, providing insight into the structure and history of the Milky Way galaxy. They are between 13,000 and 220,000 light years from the Sun, and are considered some of the oldest in the Milky Way. Her research has enabled some of the first studies of the structure and properties of the whole halo of the Milky Way and not only its innermost parts.

### Hiranya Peiris

- **2018**: British astrophysicists Hiranya Peiris and Joanna Dunkley and Italian cosmologist Licia Verde were among 27 scientists awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their contributions to "detailed maps of the early universe that greatly improved our knowledge of the evolution of the cosmos and the fluctuations that seeded the formation of galaxies".

- She is best known for her work on the cosmic microwave background radiation, and interdisciplinary links between cosmology and high-energy physics. She was one of 27 scientists who received the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in 2018 for their "detailed maps of the early universe".

- In 2012, the WMAP team (including Peiris) won the Gruber Cosmology Prize for their "exquisite measurements of anisotropies in the relic radiation from the Big Bang—the Cosmic Microwave Background". WMAP's results on cosmic inflation, which Peiris contributed to, were described by Stephen Hawking as "the most exciting development in physics during his career".

### Joanna Dunkley

- **2018**: British astrophysicists Hiranya Peiris and Joanna Dunkley and Italian cosmologist Licia Verde were among 27 scientists awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their contributions to "detailed maps of the early universe that greatly improved our knowledge of the evolution of the cosmos and the fluctuations that seeded the formation of galaxies".

- After her DPhil, she joined Princeton University as a postdoctoral research fellow in 2006, working with David Spergel and Lyman Page on NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). In an interview at Princeton in 2017, Spergel said she quickly "made major contributions to the analysis that led to the development of what we now think of as the standard model of cosmology." Soon after she began working with the European Space Agency (ESA) Planck satellite, which produced a higher-resolution view of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) compared to WMAP.

- Dunkley led analysis for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile, using gravitational lensing to identify dark matter. At Oxford her work included constraints on the number of possible neutrino species in the world. Her research combines theoretical physics with statistical analysis and uses her models to understand the universe from cosmological observations.

### Licia Verde

- **2018**: British astrophysicists Hiranya Peiris and Joanna Dunkley and Italian cosmologist Licia Verde were among 27 scientists awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their contributions to "detailed maps of the early universe that greatly improved our knowledge of the evolution of the cosmos and the fluctuations that seeded the formation of galaxies".

- Her research interests include large-scale structure, dark matter, dark energy, inflation and the cosmic microwave background. She is known primarily for work on large-scale structure, analysis of the WMAP data and development of rigorous statistical tools to analyse surveys of the universe. She is a highly cited author.

- Verde analyzed a powerful but challenging statistical property of galaxy surveys related to higher-order correlations. She showed that the galaxy redshift survey conducted with the Anglo-Australian Telescope trace the distribution of dark matter; this result indicated that the galaxy distribution can be used to study the dark matter one.

- After she joined the science team of the Microwave Anisotropy Probe, a NASA space mission to map the full sky at radio waves, Verde participated in analysis and interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background data from the WMAP satellite.

- Under her lead, her research group has contributed to results from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Survey part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: measurements of the expansion history of the universe and the formation of cosmological structures as well as constraint on cosmological parameters describing structure and detailed composition of the cosmos.

- The other recent direction of Verde's research is on dark energy. She has developed a model-independent way to study the Universe's expansion history and infer from there the physical properties of dark energy.
